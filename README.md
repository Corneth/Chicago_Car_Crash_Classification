## Introduction:
in this project we will be attempting to classify the Chicago car crash dataset from Chicagos open data portal.

## Contents:
The contents of this repository are:
    Data: The folder that holds all my data that I have used.
    OSEMN: The Jupyter notebook that has my all my code.
    Presentation: Pdf of project
   
### Background Information:
The city of Chicago founded a program called the Vision Zero Chicago, to try to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries from traffic crashes. Their view is that even one life lost in a traffic crash is unacceptable no matter where or what it is you are doing and that the roads are safe for everyone. Vision Zero has policies, partnerships and technologies that they believe will prevent death and serious injury from traffic accidents. They believe that crashes are not accidents, and that they are preventable and are commited to using all the tools they have to change the way people see it. They are commited to reducing the cause of death and serious injury and will use all the resources they have, including community engagement


## Project goals:
   -my objective of this project is to find out what could be the leading cause of the accidents based off the premise that it is either the drivers fault or not.
   

    
## Method:
- I will be getting the full data from the Chicago open data portal and performing EDA as well as sampling the first 50K results that show up.
- Fitting the data to a Random Tree Classifier after splitting the data into training and testing data at a 60/40 split

- Interpreting the data into recommendations that Chicago can do to progress farther into thier goal.
